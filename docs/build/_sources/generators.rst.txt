Generators
==========

Run Dynamics
-------------
The :mod:`imeall.slabmaker` the :mod:`imeall.run_dyn` modules are responsible 
for generating the canonical `imeall.gb_models.GrainBoundary` structures and a representative spanning set of 
microscopic initializations of the :class:`imeall.gb_models.SubGrainBoundary` structures for atomistic relaxation.

Both modules also runs as a command line tool. To see the command line documentation:
  ``python run_dyn.py -h``

.. automodule:: imeall.run_dyn
  :members:

Relaxation
----------
The :mod:`imeall.relax` module handles relaxation of a :class:`SubGrainBoundary`. 
This module also runs as a command line tool.

.. automodule:: imeall.relax
  :members:
