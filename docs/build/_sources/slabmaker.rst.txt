Slabmaker
=========

This module contains builder methods for generating grain boundary structures.
Currently supports builders for generating symmetric tilt and twist grain boundaries
in BCC crystals.

Standard quaternion algebra routines are provided by the ``transformations.py`` library
developed by `Christoph Gohlke <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/>`_.
