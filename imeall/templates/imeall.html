<p> <code>Imeall</code> (IM-UHLL) is a database framework for calculations relating to the 
atomistic properties of dislocations, grain boundaries, and fracture simulations in materials.  </p>

<h2><code>Imeall</code> Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>The grain boundaries are generated and labeled according to a uniform process indicated by the following notation:</p>
<pre><code>  Theta[XXX](YYY)</code></pre>
<p>Theta is the angle of misorientation in degrees around the orientation axis [XXX]. The boundary plane (YYY) 
determines the plane of the interface between the misoriented Grain A and Grain B. In this way it is 
possible to uniquely characterize all grain boundaries. Grain boundaries characterized by these three quantities 
are considered `canonical` grains.</p>

<p> An additional set of three degrees of freedom is then used to extend the above definition. The additional degrees of 
freedom correspond to a rigid body translation in the two dimensional plain of the grain boundary, one 
relative to the other, and a volume relaxation orthogonal to the grain boundary plane. These atomic 
scale degrees of freedom compose subgrains of the canonical parent grain. Further variations of the grain include
vacancies and impurities which also compose new subgrains of the canonical grain. Subgrains are stored in a hierarchical
format below the canonical grain.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we assign the idealized crystalline bulk structure the notation:</p>
<pre><code>  0000000000</code></pre>
<p>
The structures are stored locally in the database 
as <a href="https://libatoms.github.io/QUIP/io.html#module-ase.io.extxyz">extended XYZ</a> files. 
</p>


<h2 id="using-imeall">Using Imeall</h2>
<p>Locally the <code> Imeall </code> server  can be accessed through your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.</p>

<p> 
    The home page contains a list of links for each material in the database under: 
    <pre><a href="#localdatabase">Local Database</a>.</pre>
    Each link leads to a view of different orientation axes vectors for which grain boundary properties have been computed.
</p>

<p> 
   For instance: 
   <pre><code>/alphaFe/110</code></pre> contains all computed 110 grain boundaries for BCC iron. The [000] orientation axes directory contains
   calculations pertaining to a perfect crystal, fracture simulations along different cleavage 
   planes and singular defects and vacancies in a perfect crystal.
</p>

<p> Within each orientation axes is a list of full grain boundaries. Each of these contains a snap shot of the 
unrelaxed grain boundary structure (the canonical boundary), the coincident site lattice, and a list of sub-directories 
containing the type of calculations performed on the grain boundary. The subdirectories store atomic 
scale properties according to calculation type. Examples of calculation types include: 
tight binding models, EAMs, DFT, etc. 
If multiple &quot;flavours&quot; of each calculation type are to be used the directories can take more specific names: 
EAM_Mishin, DFT_PW, DFT_VASP etc. Within each calc_type of directories is the pattern gbid_'suffix'. These subdirectories
are considered &quot;Subgrains&quot; of the canonical grain. These subgrains constitute the inclusion of defects, vacancies, dislocations
and other modifications to the canonical grain.

<h3>Subgrain Directories</h3>
The suffix denotes the modification to the canonical grain boundary structure. This could constitute a 
pattern like <code>_d2.0</code> which denotes: delete one of a pair of atoms from the original grain boundary 
structure with nearest neighbour distance less than or equal to 2 <span>&#8491;</span>. Another suffix pattern might be displace the canonical grain along the in-plane lattice vectors by a 
distance 0.25*lattice vector: <code> _tv0.25bxv0.25 </code>. Suffices can be 
combined: <code>_tv0.25bxv0.25_d2.0</code>. A key for some common suffix patterns is given here:</p>
<pre><code> 
  _v2bxv6        : supercell 2 times along orientation axis 6 times along the normal to the orientation axis.
  _tv0.13bxv0.25 : displace one grain 0.13*v along v and 0.25*bxv along bxv.
  _d2.0z         : delete one of pair of atoms within distance 2.0 <span>&#8491;</span> of each other.
  _h2.0n1        : 1 additional hydrogen atom in system 2.0 <span>&#8491;</span> from a grainboundary.
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  Systematic use of these naming conventions ensures that at the analysis 
  stage grain boundary properties can be retrieved, compared, and 
  combined easily.
</p>

<p>The canonical grain contains a file:</p>
<pre><code>  gb.json</code></pre>
<p>subsequent directories each contain a file:</p>
<pre><code>  subgb.json</code></pre>
<p>This json file contains information about relevant grain boundary properties in the usual key:value format. Some common keys are:</p>
<pre><code>  E_gb_init : Unrelaxed Grain Boundary Energy.
  E_gb      : Relaxed Grain Boundary Energy.
  n_at      : Number of atoms in the grain boundary.
  A         : Grain Boundary area in the unit cell.</code></pre>
<p> 
Upon subsequent analysis new key:values pairs can be added to the json dictionaries as required.
Either by directly editing the json file or through the python API when new calculations are performed.
</p>

<h3> PH </h3>
<p>A subgrain directory may also contain a directory labeled <code>/PH/</code>. This directory contains 
calculations pertaining to vibrational properties of the system: i.e. 
the phonon density of states, bandstructures,
and free energies/entropies determined within the quasiharmonic approximation. 
Again calculations are organized by the calc_type property (EAM, TB, DFT). 
Vibrational properties are typically calculated using 
the <a href="https://atztogo.github.io/phonopy/">phonopy</a> code. Force constant matrices
can also be stored in the /PH/ sub-directories.</p>

<h3> /000/ </h3>
<p> 
The <code>/000/</code> directory contains many "subgrains" of the unperturbed ideal crystal. 
This directory is likely to contain isolated edge and screw dislocations, fracture simulations
along different cleavage planes, <span>&#611;</span>-surface calculations for different glide planes,
vibrational properties of the ideal crystal, and all the same again for the 
ideal crystal with defects or interstitials. Dislocations, defects, and 
fracture simulations in the presence of grainboundaries should be stored as 
subgrains under the appropriate canonical grainboundary database.
</p>

{#<h3> Remote Databases </h3> 
  <p> <code>Imeall</code> provides a framework for synchronizing the local database, which contains
  the output of calculations, with the production servers (typically remote servers). To inspect the local
  synchronization logs go to:
  <pre><a href ={{url_for('synchronization')}}>Database Synchronization</a></pre>
  </p>
#}

<div class="database">
<h3> Local Database </h3>
  <a name="localdatabase"></a>
  <p> All structures and parameter files in the database can be downloaded. 
  The local database contains the following materials: </p>
  <ul class=entries>
  {% for material in materials %}
    <li> <pre><a href={{ url_for('material', material=material)}}>{{material}}</a></em><pre></li>
  {% endfor%}
  </ul>
</div>
