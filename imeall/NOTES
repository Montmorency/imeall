why would trying to access the flask
  g.gbid give me this:

OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'/Users/lambert/pymodules/imeall/imeall/./grain_boundaries/apple-touch-icon.png'

Dealing with routing errors. If you are appending paths to a url (or
you want the paths to be reflected in the url Flask deals with trailing
flashes in a particular way. From the Docs:

1.) If a rule ends with a slash and is requested without a slash
    by the user, the user is automatically redirected to the same page with a
    trailing slash attached.
2.) If a rule does not end with a trailing slash and the user requests the page
    with a trailing slash, a 404 not found is raised.

On the flask example page it mentioned reddits link tricks so that you could 
concatenate two views in the url.
print app.url_map lists all the routes
